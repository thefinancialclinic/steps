# About

There are two packages here for the STEPS bot:

* The API backend, an expressjs REST server connected to a PostgreSQL database
* A React frontend for the admin interface

We're using [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to manage these two interrelated apps.

# Dependencies

* Node 8.11.3

# Local development

## Setup for local development

### DB config

We're using sqitch to manage the database migrations.
You will need postgres along with its command line tools (part of normal install).
The provided config assumes a postgres user `postgres` with a blank password.

```
brew tap theory/sqitch
brew install sqitch_pg
createdb steps_admin_test
sqitch deploy
```

You should see something similar to:

```
Deploying changes to steps
  + appschema .. ok
```

If you see that, then the DB is ready to rock.

### Adding a new DB migration

To add a new migration:

```
sqitch add --change <change name> --requires <previous migration> --note <comment>
```

- `<change name>` will become the file name of the migration
- `<previous migration>` is any migration required as a precondition for this migration
- `<comment>` describe the reason for the migration. This comment will be auditable later.

This creates three files:

- `apps/api/migration/deploy/<change name>.sql` The forward or "up" migration.
- `apps/api/migration/revert/<change name>.sql` Undoes the migration.
- `apps/api/migration/verify/<change name>.sql` Check that the migration was applied successfully.

Then deploy the migration with `sqitch deploy`.

Here is a real-world scenario:

```
sqitch add user_add_unique_email -n "[coach] Duplicate emails allowed for Coach and client objects, breaks auth." -r appschema
```

We use `-r appschema` or `--requires appschema` as a shortcut for run in the order of creation ensuring the DB exists.

### Refresh with latest build

```
git checkout develop
git pull
npm install
$(npm bin)/lerna exec "npm install"
$(npm bin)/lerna bootstrap
sqitch deploy
cp .env.example .env 
```

The last step will create an .env file with only the key names. Here is an example of the .env file with values filled in:

```
API_URL="http://localhost:3001/api"
AUTH0_AUDIENCE="http://steps-admin.herokuapp.com"
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="<removed for security>"
AUTH0_DOMAIN="steps.auth0.com"
AUTH0_ENABLED=true
AUTH0_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3000/authenticate"
AUTH0_MAGIC_LINK_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3000/magic-link"
BOT_URL="https://mockbin.org/request"
NODE_ENV="development"
PORT="3001"
SENDGRID_API_KEY="<removed for security>"
SENDGRID_ENABLED=true
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
AUTH0_SUPERADMIN_ID=<removed for security>
CYPRESS_AUTH0_BEARER_TOKEN="<removed for security"
```

### App Execute
Change directories to the project root (where this README is).
Provided that you've installed everything called for in [setup](#setup), run:

```
NODE_ENV=development npm start    # run packages in parallel
```

Now visit <http://localhost:3000>

## Testing

### Execute tests

In the root of the project (parent dir of `/apps`), run:

```
npm test
```

which should immediately run:
`$(npm bin)/lerna run test` and so in turn runs tests in each project.

# Authentication/Authorization

There are some environment variables that configure our [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
integration. These are:

* AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
* AUTH0_ISSUER

These can be set at the command line or, more conveniently can be put in the
`.env` file.

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<Auth0 Client ID>
AUTH0_ISSUER=<Auth0 Issuer>
```

If this `.env` file is successfully loaded, you should see the message,
_"Reading .env file..."_ on the command line when the application starts.

## Issuing a new Bot token

The chatbot application uses a long-lived [machine-to-machine token](https://auth0.com/blog/using-m2m-authorization/)
to access the API. (We issued a token valid for 100 days at launchâ€”if you're reading this before October 17 2018, you're not too late). Here's how the machine to machine application is set up, and how to issue a new token manually before it expires:

The machine-to-machine application for the Hello Roo bot is configured under "Applications" on the Auth0 dashboard:

![Auth0 Applications dashboard](docs/applications-dashboard.png?raw=true "Auth0 Applications dashboard")

Click through to the app and you can select the APIs it's authorized to access:

![Hello Roo Bot application](docs/bot-application.png?raw=true "Hello Roo Bot application")

To issue a new token, select the "Hello Roo API" under the "APIs" section of the Auth0 dashboard:

![Auth0 APIs dashboard](docs/api-dashboard.png?raw=true "API dashboard")

The "Settings" tab will allow you to configure token expiration:

![Auth0 APIs dashboard settings tab](docs/settings-tab.png?raw=true "Auth0 APIs dashboard settings tab")

To get a new token by hand, visit the "Test" tab. Making the HTTP request shown there using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) will return a new valid API token:

![Auth0 APIs dashboard test tab](docs/test-tab.png?raw=true "Auth0 APIs dashboard test tab")

Note that the bot can retrieve a new token at any time by issuing this request itself! That means the bot can automate the process of retrieving a new API token: check the [`exp`](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-token) date in the current access token on a regular schedule, send an HTTP requsest to get a new one when it's getting old, and store and use the new token.
